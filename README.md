# UPS information system

```
This is a web app used to record a number of shipped items using an item number and some extra information 
about it to deliver each item to its destination which is retail center using an unique ID and extra 
information about the retail center. 
It also, records the transportation method which can be more than one for each item using schedule number 
and extra information about the transportation method.
